# Applying Defocus Blur Detection on Documents

Scope:
  - Build a U-Net and one state-of-the-art supervised model and train them on the DeFBD+ (enhanced version of CUHK and DUT) dataset
  - Create a dataset based on the CVL-DataBase with synthetic blur
  - Evaluate the performance of the network as is in the domain of documents on the specified dataset using metrics used by other works, like MAE, F-measure, precision-recall curve
  - Fine-tune the network on the specified dataset and evaluate the performance again, comparing it to before the fine-tuning.
